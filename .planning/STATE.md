## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Pre-roadmap: Use Strategy A for CSS variable migration (keep names, change values) — prevents silent breakage of 196 references
- Pre-roadmap: Cormorant Garamond selected to replace Playfair Display — confirm final choice before Phase 1
- Pre-roadmap: OKLCH format is canonical for Tailwind 4 @theme — reconcile hex values from research before Phase 1
- Pre-roadmap: Dashboard mobile nav pattern (bottom nav vs sidebar) — must decide before Phase 6

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Font final decision: Cormorant Garamond vs DM Serif Display — needed before Phase 1 starts
- OKLCH canonical values: reconcile STACK.md (OKLCH) vs FEATURES.md (hex) before Phase 1
- Dashboard mobile nav pattern: decide before Phase 6
- iOS Safari real-device access: required before Phase 4 ships
