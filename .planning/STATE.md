## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Pre-roadmap: Use Strategy A for CSS variable migration (keep names, change values) — prevents silent breakage of 196 references
- Pre-roadmap: Cormorant Garamond selected to replace Playfair Display — confirm final choice before Phase 1
- Pre-roadmap: OKLCH format is canonical for Tailwind 4 @theme — reconcile hex values from research before Phase 1
- Pre-roadmap: Dashboard mobile nav pattern (bottom nav vs sidebar) — must decide before Phase 6

### Pending Todos
