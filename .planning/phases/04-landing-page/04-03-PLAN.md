  <name>Task 1: Visual QA of complete landing page</name>
  <files>src/app/(public)/page.tsx</files>
  <action>Run dev server and present landing page for visual verification across desktop and mobile viewports.</action>
  <what-built>
Complete landing page redesign with 7 components:
- LandingNav: transparent-to-solid scroll behavior + mobile hamburger menu
- Hero: full viewport, grain texture, animated chat messages, dual CTA
- Features: 3 updated cards (AI Asistent, Interaktivni management planovani, Web pro hosty)
- SocialProof: 3 stats on warm background
- HowItWorks: 3-step visual flow
- FinalCTA: gradient background with white CTA button
- LandingFooter: brand logo + copyright
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev` (or confirm it's already running)
2. Open http://localhost:3000 in a desktop browser

**Desktop checks:**
- [ ] Nav is transparent at top, becomes white+blur after scrolling ~60px
- [ ] Hero fills the viewport with grain texture visible as subtle paper noise
- [ ] Chat messages appear one by one with sequential delays (not all at once)
- [ ] Floating stats card visible on right side of chat mockup
- [ ] "Vyzkoušet zdarma" and "Přihlásit se" CTAs are styled correctly
- [ ] Scroll down: Features section with 3 cards fading in with stagger
- [ ] Social proof stats visible (500+, 40h, 4.9★) on warm background
- [ ] How-it-works 3 steps animate in
- [ ] Final CTA gradient section with white button
- [ ] Footer with Svoji logo and copyright

**Mobile checks (resize browser to ~375px width):**
- [ ] Hamburger icon visible, opens slide-down menu on tap
- [ ] Hero content readable, not clipped
- [ ] All sections stack vertically without horizontal overflow
- [ ] Feature cards stack to single column
- [ ] Stats stack vertically

**Animation checks:**
- [ ] ScrollReveal fires on scroll (sections fade+slide in)
- [ ] No animation jank on scroll
- [ ] Chat messages appear sequentially (first message, then AI reply, then second exchange)
